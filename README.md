# Milestone Project 1 - West Norfolk Lawn Tennis Club website

![Mockup on different screen sizes of home page](documentation/mockup.png)
Welcome to my first milestone project with the Code Institute. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have learnt so far in the form of a static website, built with HTML and CSS and using Bootstrap as a framework.

## UX & UI
### Project Goals
The project goal is to create a static website that is responsive, accessible and coherent to the user. The webpages will have a clear design structure that will be consistant for all pages. This will allow the user of the website to navigate the pages intuitively.

### Customer Goals
The customer in this scenario is a local tennis club. The tennis club wants to increase it's online presence in order to improve member numbers and promote various tournaments that are held at the club over the year. The website will give prospective members information about the club (history, facilities, contact information) and make it simple to enquire about a membership. The clubs activities and events will also be shared through the website further showcasing the attractiveness of membership. The club would want members to be able to manage their own memberships online, including payment, and create court bookings however this is not within the scope of this release. Currently court bookings are performed through a third party site, ClubSpark, and memberships are submitted by filling out paper forms. Using a third party site incurs charges for one-off guest fees and memberships fees.

### Features
In order to create an easy to use website a navigation bar will be accesible at the top of the page with links to various pages. This navigation bar may be too large for smaller screens therefore it will be made to collapse for mobiles. A carousel of the club's photos will be displayed to allow a new user, at first landing on the page, to cycle through. A welcome section and a news section will also feature on the home page, with the latter linking to other pages and articles dedicated to that news item. The footer of the webpage will include icons for various social media accounts.

### User Stories
#### As a member of the club
- I want to be able to access the latest news about the club, emails get lost in my inbox or unintentionally deleted.
- I want to be able to manage my membership online rather than using a paper form.
- I want to be able to book courts online to ensure that the facilities are available when I want to play.
#### As the chairman of the club
- I want to increase the number of members by showing off what the club has to offer.
- I want the website to make it as easy as possible for potential new members to sign up to the club.
- The website design must appeal to all members, young and old.
- I want information about the club available for potential new members.
- I want the website to look professional, giving the club a feel of quality.
#### As a potential new member
- The website should give me all the information I need and promote the club in a way that makes me want to become a member.
- I want an easy way of signing up, giving me instant access to the club and all of it's available facilities.

### Wireframes
Before any code was written wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for each page on three different screen sizes; mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Design Choices
The website is for a tennis club that will be used by people of different ages and must have a professional quality to it. The following design choices have been made based on this.

#### Font
The font used is Gill Sans. This fits in with the logo font and has a modern feel.
#### Icons
The icons used are from the font awesome free library. As no brand icon for ClubSpark was available a bolt was used in it's place that closely resembles the ClubSpark logo.
#### Colours
To ensure the website has a clean look, minimal use of colour was applied. A dark green/grey was used along with contrasting white. The colour for the  sign up 'Become a Member' button was chosen based on the colour of the tennis ball. The famous yellow-green tennis ball colour is called _optic yellow_ and it's hex color code is #ccff00. The colour really stands out on the page against the minimal background colours.
#### Styling
A carousel is used on the home page showcasing all images used in the website. Excluding the navbar, which spans across the entire width of the page, all other containers are centered on the page whcih gives a good looking, coherent design across multiple device screen sizes.
The active nav-item has had the border CSS from Bootstrap's 'btn' class applied to give it the same look as the sign up button.
#### Images
The images have been taken from the club's [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/305550273422129). Permission to use them was given by the page's admin, Jeremy Hodges.
